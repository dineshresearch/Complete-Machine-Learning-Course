Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost) is similar to gradient boosting framework but more efficient. It has both a linear model solver and tree learning algorithms

The overall parameters have been divided into 3 categories by XGBoost authors:

General Parameters: Guide the overall functioning
Booster Parameters: Guide the individual booster (tree/regression) at each step
Learning Task Parameters: Guide the optimization performed
 

General Parameters
These define the overall functionality of XGBoost.

booster [default=gbtree]
Select the type of model to run at each iteration. It has 2 options:
gbtree: tree-based models
gblinear: linear models
