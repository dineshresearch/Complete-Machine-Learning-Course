## üéØ About This Course

This course was designed with a "first principles" approach. Instead of just using libraries as black boxes, we explore the statistical and mathematical ideas that make these algorithms work. The materials are structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to follow along, execute code, and experiment with the concepts in real-time.
